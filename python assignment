# # python assignment 

Create a program that generates random fortune cookie messages.

The program should display one of three messages each time it is run: "Today will be a lucky day", "You will meet someone new and interesting", or "Watch out for obstacles in your path".

To do this, you can use the random module and the if and elif statements to select one of the messages at random.

#### CODE .....

import random

def fortune_cookie():
    message = random.randint(1,3)
    if message == 1:
        print("Today will be a lucky day")
    elif message == 2:
        print("You will meet someone new and interesting")
    elif message == 3:
        print("Watch out for obstacles in your path")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fortune_cookie()
