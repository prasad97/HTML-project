PYTHON ASSIGNMNENT 


####Create a program that generates random fortune cookie messages.

The program should display one of three messages each time it is run: "Today will be a lucky day", "You will meet someone new and interesting", or "Watch out for obstacles in your path".

To do this, you can use the random module and the if and elif statements to select one of the messages at random.


### CODE:

import random

def generate_fortune():
    num = random.randint(1, 3)
    if num == 1:
        print("Today will be a lucky day")
    elif num == 2:
        print("You will meet someone new and interesting")
    elif num == 3:
        print("Watch out for obstacles in your path")

generate_fortune()
